      <Typography variant="body1">
        <Box sx={{ m:1, p:0.5}}> The main aim of this project is to implement a tool that will guide usability engineers to design without bias related to the users’ wealth and location. It should provide engineers with relevant data for their intended user group to help identify appropriate usability principles depending on the feedback gathered from a variety of users. The feedback will help to contextualise the design principles, supporting usability engineers in designing interfaces that are likely to be more usable for the intended user population and meeting the universal design principles. The tool should aim to be accessible to a wide range of designers to reduce their inability to communicate with a certain population due to language barriers and/or cost factors.
